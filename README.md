## Firebase Configuration

This application contains a firebase connection. I have not included my api key. To access firebase, you have to create your own firestore and include your api key in the environment file(src/environments/environment.ts).

## Install Dependencies

You have to install dependencies before running the application. To install the dependencies run `npm install` on your terminal inside the project directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
